# LEGOS Developer Guide

# Node-Sass Version
The current version of LEGOS (v1.x) requires node-sass v4.7.2 - newer versions will not work correctly with the SCSS sources coming from the MDC library.

## Editor Configuration
Please use a text editor / IDE / plugin which can read and respond to the settings in [our .editorconfig file](https://github.carmax.com/CarMax/online-systems-legos/blob/master/.editorconfig).

## NPM Link
In order to consume the LEGOS Component libray within another project, we make use of NPM Link. This allows you, the developer, to make edits to both the LEGOS component library and your consuming project, with updates to LEGOS reflected in your consuming project.

````shell
# current working directory root is /online-systems-legos
# 1 - make online-systems-legos locally available to other projects:
npm link

# current working directory root is /<your consuming project repo>
# 2 - link online-systems-legos within your project:
npm link online-systems-legos
````

> **NOTE**: Unlink both projects prior to installing or updating NPM dependencies. After a successful update to the dependencies, relink in the order shown above.

````shell
# current working directory root is /<your consuming project repo>
# 1 - unlink online-systems-legos within your project:
npm unlink online-systems-legos

# current working directory root is /online-systems-legos
# 2 - unlink online-systems-legos making it unavailable to other projects:
npm unlink
````

## Commit Messages

A short one-line summary of the change. This is the line that'll be seen most often, make it terse but descriptive. You may add additional information to the commit message by starting your long description after the commit message and a blank line:

````git
This is the commit message

And this is the longer, more descriptive prose I will offer as additional color and documentation for anyone who cares to read it.
````

If the files you are commiting cannot be effectively assigned a terse but descriptive commit message, consider breaking your contribution into several commits, each carrying a set of related changes. Thereâ€™s no (practical) limit to the number of commits in a given pull-request, and atomic commits are easier to peer review, cherry-pick, and even roll-back if necessary.
