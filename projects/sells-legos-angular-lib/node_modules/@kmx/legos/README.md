## CarMax Design System is a user-interface component library built in order to maintain consistency across our products and to expedite the development effort ##

This repository contains all code for:
* [design.carmax.com](http://design.carmax.com)

## Influence ##
CarMax Design System is built on the principles of [Google Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/), and specifically builds on top of the [Material Components Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) project.

---

## Requirements ##
This repository requires the following to be installed on your machine:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime environment. Enables all things JavaScript outside of the browser - local dev servers, task runners, compilation & bundling...ya know.

---

## Tools ##
A non-exhaustive list of notable tools we use:

* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - Compiles static assets (CSS, JS, etc.) for delivery & browser consumption.
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - View library. Fantastic for building apps and NOT MANIPULATING THE DOM DIRECTLY.

---

## Development ##

* Most of your front-end dev will happen in `./src/components/`.
* Refer to `webpack.config.js` to see how our assets are compiled & bundled up for delivery.
