# 1.0.0 (2018-03-01)

[The LEGOS Team](http://design.carmax.com/overview/legos-team) is happy to announce the MVP release of the [CarMax Design System](https://design.carmax.com/)!

## Features

### Foundation

- **[Breakpoints](https://design.carmax.com/foundation/breakpoints):** Breakpoints are the point at which your site’s content will respond to provide the user with the best possible layout to consume the information.
- **[Colors](https://design.carmax.com/foundation/colors):** The official CarMax colors. For the most part, stick with the Primary Color Palette.
- **[Elevation](https://design.carmax.com/foundation/elevation):** Elevation visually indicates depth on CarMax.com. This provides shadows and light perspective for everything from dialogs to menus to action buttons.
- **[Icons](https://design.carmax.com/foundation/icons):** Icons should function simply and effectively. Icons can visually help users understand a message or complete a task with reduced effort.
- **[Layout Grid](https://design.carmax.com/foundation/layout-grid):** The layout grid system is a visual organization pattern for arranging and composing user-interfaces in a consistent manner. The layout grid system aims to enable quick component arrangement while offering responsive flexibility for differently-sized screens.
- **[Spacing](https://design.carmax.com/foundation/spacing):** This design system uses multiples of 8px for all spacing values: dimensions, padding, and margins. The goal behind this is to achieve a consistent visual rhythm.
- **[Typography](https://design.carmax.com/foundation/typography):** This standardizes how text should be displayed. Further documentation about how different text styles should interact with each other is coming in Q1 FY19.

### Components

- **[Breadcrumbs](https://design.carmax.com/components/breadcrumbs):** Breadcrumbs are a navigation molecule that shows a user's current location within a site, and provides SEO benefit.
- **[Buttons](https://design.carmax.com/components/buttons):** Buttons are the window to a website's soul. This standardizes how buttons should display and function across CarMax digital properties.
- **[Dialogs](https://design.carmax.com/components/dialogs):** Dialogs inform users about a specific task and/or critical information without leaving the context of the current webpage.
- **[Forms](http://design.carmax.com/components/forms):** Forms should be a logical and approachable conversation between CarMax and customers. Use the Stepper component to break up longer forms.
  - **[Checkboxes](http://design.carmax.com/components/forms/checkboxes):** Used when there are lists of options and the user may select zero, one, or multiple options. In other words, each checkbox is independent of all other checkboxes in the list, so checking one box doesn't un-check the others.
  - **[Dropdowns](http://design.carmax.com/components/forms/dropdowns):** Dropdowns conserve screen space and prevent users from entering erroneous data, since they only show predefined options.
  - **[Radio Buttons](http://design.carmax.com/components/forms/radio-buttons):** Used when there is a list of two or more options that are mutually exclusive and the user must select exactly one choice. Clicking a non-selected radio button will deselect whatever other button was previously selected in the list.
  - **[Sliders](http://design.carmax.com/components/forms/sliders):** Sliders are ideal components for customers to make a single or range selection within a predefined range.
  - **[Switches](http://design.carmax.com/components/forms/switches):** On/off switches toggle the state of a single settings option. The option that the switch controls, as well as the state it’s in, should be made clear from the corresponding inline label. Switches take on the same visual properties of the radio button.
  - **[Text Fields](http://design.carmax.com/components/forms/text-fields):** A text field is a single or multi-line box that enables the user to enter text. Text fields are the most common form component. Use the Stepper component to break up forms that contain an overwhelming number of text fields.
- **[Icon Toggles](https://design.carmax.com/components/icon-toggles):** Icon toggles are to be used when a single choice can be selected or deselected, such as adding or removing a heart (favorite) to an item.
- **[Lists](https://design.carmax.com/components/lists):** A List is an element used to present multiple vertical line items.
  - **[Single Line](http://design.carmax.com/components/lists/1-line):** List items that each only have a title, respectively.
  - **[Two Line](http://design.carmax.com/components/lists/2-line):** List items that each have a title and description line, respectively.
  - **[Three Line](http://design.carmax.com/components/lists/3-line):** Like a two-line list, but with multi-line text under each respective title.
- **[Non-Sortable Tables](https://design.carmax.com/components/tables-non-sortable):** Non-sortable Tables help clearly present information in rows, separated into two columns.
- **[Pagination](https://design.carmax.com/components/pagination):** Pagination is the component that will divide our search results and research articles into discrete and digestible pages. Please note the math involved with how many numbers and arrows to show.
- **[Progress Indicators](https://design.carmax.com/components/progress-indicators):** Progress and activity indicators are visual indications of loading content or other activity. There are options for both a determinate (e.g. exactly 64% loaded) and indeterminate loading (e.g. a behind the scenes process is running).
- **[Snackbars](https://design.carmax.com/components/snackbars):** Snackbars provide brief feedback/notification at the bottom of the screen.
- **[Steppers](https://design.carmax.com/components/steppers):** Steppers display progress through a sequence of logical and numbered steps. They guide the user through a number of steps in order to complete a specified task. A good Stepper should inform users about what steps have been completed, the current step the user is on, and how many steps remain in the process. These are great for long forms.
- **[Store List Labels](https://design.carmax.com/components/store-list-labels):** These labels indicate information on a CarMax Store List (see Patterns below) and store map.
- **[Tabs](https://design.carmax.com/components/tabs):** Tabs are used to create tabbed navigation components that allow users to switch between different groupings of content on the same plane.

### Patterns

- **[Contextual Search](http://design.carmax.com/patterns/contextual-search):** When an app supports large amounts of information, users should be able to quickly locate content by searching for it. Basic search involves: opening a search text field, entering and submitting a query, & displaying a set of search results. _This is not intended for global inventory search_.
- **[Secondary Header](http://design.carmax.com/patterns/secondary-header):** Standardizes our approach to the secondary header, with examples for both simple and complex functionality.
- **[Stores List](http://design.carmax.com/patterns/stores-list):** Store List Labels show a list of CarMax stores, often with a corresponding map.
